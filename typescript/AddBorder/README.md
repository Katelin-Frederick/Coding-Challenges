# Add Border

Given a rectangular matrix of characters, add a border of asterisks(*) to it.
*Note:\* Not all strings in the matrix will necessarily be the same length
When they are not the same length, the extra askterisks should be added to the end of the string

###### Example 1:

```
Input: ["abc",
        "def"]
Output: ["*****"
         "*abc*",
         "*def*",
         "*****"]
```

###### Example 2:

```
Input: ["abcde",
        "fgh"]
Output: ["*******"
         "*abcde*",
         "*fgh***",
         "*******"]
```
