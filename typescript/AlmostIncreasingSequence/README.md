# Almost Increasing Sequence

Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

###### Example 1:

```
Input: [1, 3, 2, 1]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.
```

###### Example 2:

```
Input: digits = [1, 3, 2]
Output: true
Explanation: You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].
```
