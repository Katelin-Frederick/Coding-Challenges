# Coding Challenges

This repository is a collection of coding challenges along with their solutions and test cases.

Each challenge contains:

- Markdown file with the prompt/instructions
- Test file with respective test cases
- File with the solution to the prompt/testcases

Currently, all challenges are in typescript but I intend to expand to other languages in the future.
